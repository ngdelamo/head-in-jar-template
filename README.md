Head-In-Jar-Template
====================

An SVG with a Futurama-like jar for creating head-in-jar drawings. The jar looks as follows:

![Jar preview](head-in-jar.png)

All you need to do is... well, draw the head :) The jar was created with Inkscape, and all the elements are grouped together. You can ungroup them (Ctrl+Shift+G) to change the name, the z-index of individual elements, etc. For example, when you add a drawing of a head, you can place it behind the front edges of the ellipses on the top.
